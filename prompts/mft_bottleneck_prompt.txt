Consider a scenario: {scenario}. 
We define a "frame" for a scenario as a list of following questions.

Question 1: How much do the following norms apply to this scenario. For a norm (L/ R), estimate a value on scale [-5, 5], where -5 implies an extreme act of L, and 5 implies an extreme act of R. Note that a value of 0 implies that the norm does not apply.

Norm #1. Harm/ Help
Norm #2. Cheating/ Fairness
Norm #3. Betrayal/ Loyalty
Norm #4. Subversion/ Authority
Norm #5. Degradation/ Sanctity
Norm #6. Oppression/ Liberty

Question 2: Based on all of these ratings, how morally acceptable is this scenario (on a scale of -4, 4 where -4 means absolutely unacceptable).


The  format  of the frame is the following:
{
 "Q1": [
    {
     "norm name": "Harm/ Help",
     "score (-5, 5)": xxx,
     "explanation": "because ..."
    },
   {
     "norm name": "Cheating/ Fairness",
     "score (-5, 5)": xxx,
     "explanation": "because ..."
    },
  ...
    {
     "norm name": "Oppression/ Liberty",
     "score (-5, 5)": xxx,
     "explanation": "because ..."
    }
],
   "Q2": {
       "moral acceptability (-4, 4)": xxx,
       "explanation": "because ...",
   }
}

Question A: Create a frame for the given scenario (default circumstance).
Question B: Think of 3 different common circumstances underlying this scenario. Create a frame under each circumstance. Your output format should be:

{
  "Answer A": {
                           "frame": { ... }
                       }

  "Answer B":  [
                          { "circumstance": "...",
                            "frame": { ... }
                          }
                       ]
}

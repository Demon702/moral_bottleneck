Consider a "scenario": <scenario>. 
We define a "frame" for a scenario as a list of following questions.

Q1. Who was the agent of this action?
Q2. What assumption did you make about the agent?
Q3. Who was the patient being affected by this action?
Q4. What assumption did you make about the patient?
Q5. On a scale of 1-10, how vulnerable was the patient (10 means extremely vulnerable)?
Q6. On a scale of 1-10, how intentional was the action (10 means extremely intentional)?
Q7. On a scale of 1-10, how much harm was caused (10 means extremely harmful)?
Q8. On a scale of 1-10, how much help was caused (10 means extremely helpful)?
Q9. On a scale of -4, 4, how moral was this action (-4 means extremely immoral, 4 for highly moral)?

For every question, the frame contains an answer and a very short explanation for Q5-Q9 (in a json format):
{
 "A1": "...",
 "A2": "...",
 "A3": "...",
 "A4": "...",
 "A5": "... (a number)",
 "E5": "because ...",
 "A6": "... (a number)",
 "E6": "because ...",
 "A7": "... (a number)",
 "E7": "because ...",
 "A8": "... (a number)",
 "E8": "because ...",
 "A9": "... (a number)",
 "E9": "because ..."
}

Question A: Create a frame for the given scenario (default circumstance).
Question B: Think of 3 different common circumstances underlying this scenario. Create a frame under each circumstance. Your output format should be:

{
  "Answer A": {
                           "frame": { ... }
                       }

  "Answer B":  [
                          { "circumstance": "...",
                            "frame": { ... }
                          }
                       ]
}

# Moral Bottleneck

In this work we exploit popular theories in psychology as bottleneck to improve LLM's performance on human moral alignment task.
Our method improves upon the baseline where we provide no theory and ask the LLM for a moral acceptability score.
We used two popular psychological theories MFT (Moral Foundations Theory) and TDM (Theory of Dyadic Morality).
